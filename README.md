Story: 

Where are the stations located? What are the names? How many trips? 
What is the average trip durations for men and women? 

As you can see the the first Dashboard I was able to break down all the above questions in one easy read visiulation. You are able to see where all staions are located is as well addtional details on these stations. Also in this dashboard you are able to compare the average trip duration among men and women. 

How long is an individuals trip duration?
Differnce between customer and subscribers? 

The second dashboard allows you to check a person trips(A person could search there bike_id to find there score). Also comparing age and whether someone is a subscriber or regular costomer. The theme for this assignment was how difference demographics and type of user effect length of trip. Some results were more obvious than obvious such as age. However, I found that women hold on average a longer trip length.
